The UJO Framework release notes
*******************************

release 0.82 (2008-11-23)
+ there are three new Ujo implementations for different purposes:
+ FactoryUjo: a factory to creating new instances by a property type, the special parameter constructor is supported as well as no parameter constructor
+ RegistrarUjo: the implementation allows to register the PropertyChangeListener for selected property and an action (before or after) value change
+ FieldUjo: the solution provides an access to a private object fields by UjoProperty
+ all implementations are in a different package structure and they will not in the core in the future

+ new class ListProperty extending UjoPropertyList is created for property ArrayList implementations
+ new method is UjoPropertyList.removeItem(UJO, ITEM) is added
+ new method SuperUjoExt.remove(UjoPropertyList, ITEM) is added

release 0.80 (2008-09-07)

release 0.80.rc3 (2008-08-23)

release 0.80.rc2 (2008-08-07)
+ some abstract implementations of UjoExt interface are slightly improved for better type safe features
