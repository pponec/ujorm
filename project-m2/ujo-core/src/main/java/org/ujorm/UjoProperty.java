/**
 * This interface is a descriptor of the {@link Ujo} attribute. The property contains only property meta-data
 * and therefore the UjoPropertry implementation never contains business data.Â 
 * Each instance of the Key must be located in the {@code public static final} field of some Ujo implementation.
 * The Key can't have a serializable feature never, because its instance is the unique for a related java field.
 * An appropriate solution solution for serialization is to use a decorator class KeyRing.
 * <br>See a <a href="package-summary.html#UJO">general information</a> about current framework or see some implementations.

 * @deprecated Use the inteface {@link Key} rather.
 * The interface name will not be deleted, but it will be modified as a parent of the Ujorm Key interface.
 * I'll do no later than version 1.40.
